## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. **Restart dev server** to clear Turbopack errors:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Clear cache
   rm -rf .next
   # Restart
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test all pages** in the browser to verify rendering

3. **Connect to real Firebase data** (currently using mock data)

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
1. Create `useGroups` hook for groups data fetching
2. Implement Firebase Cloud Functions for:
   - Mission completion
   - Group join/leave
   - Perk redemption
   - Admin actions (T&S)
3. Add unit tests for new components
4. Add E2E tests for dashboard flows

### Medium-term (2-4 Weeks)
1. Enable Perks feature flag (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PERKS_ENABLED=true`)
2. Set up sponsor webhooks for perk redemptions
3. Implement real-time updates with Firebase listeners
4. Add analytics tracking for user interactions
5. Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
