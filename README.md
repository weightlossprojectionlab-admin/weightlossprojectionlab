## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project (configured)
- Google Gemini API key (free tier available)

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**

   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Never commit `.env.local` to git!** It contains sensitive API keys.

   Copy the example file and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Then edit `.env.local` and add your credentials:
   ```bash
   # Required: Google Gemini API key (get free key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

   # Optional: USDA Food Data API key
   USDA_API_KEY=your-usda-api-key

   # Firebase credentials (get from Firebase Console)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   # ... (see .env.local.example for full list)
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### 🔐 Security

**Legend**: ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial (foundation ready, integration pending) | ❌ Not Started

#### Security Documentation

Comprehensive security documentation for developers and operators:

- **[Security Runbook](docs/SECURITY_RUNBOOK.md)** - Incident response procedures and emergency protocols
- **[Developer Security Guidelines](docs/DEVELOPER_SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md)** - Secure coding practices and patterns
- **[Security Architecture](docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical security design and threat model
- **[Sprint 1 & 2 Completion Report](docs/SPRINT_1_2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md)** - Detailed security fixes implemented

#### Security Testing

Run automated security tests:

```bash
# All security tests (75 tests)
npm test -- __tests__/security/

# Specific attack vector tests
npm test -- __tests__/api/fetch-url.test.ts  # SSRF protection (20 tests)
npm test -- __tests__/api/debug-endpoints.test.ts  # Production guards (14 tests)
npm test -- __tests__/lib/rate-limit.test.ts  # Rate limiting (14 tests)

# Dependency security audit
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

#### Reporting Security Issues

**🚨 Found a security vulnerability? Please report responsibly.**

- **Email**: security@wlpl.com (or primary contact email)
- **PGP Key**: [Optional: Add PGP key for encrypted reports]
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

**⚠️ DO NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) after the issue is resolved.

#### Security Best Practices for Developers

**API Key Management:**
- ✅ `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore` - your keys are safe
- ✅ Use `.env.local.example` as a template (safe to commit)
- ❌ Never commit actual API keys to version control
- ❌ Never share your `.env.local` file

**Key Rotation (if compromised):**
1. **Gemini API**: Revoke at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Firebase**: Generate new keys in Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
3. **Upstash Redis**: Rotate tokens in Upstash Console
4. **Update `.env.local`** with new keys
5. **Restart dev server**: `npm run dev`

**Required Security Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Super Admin Management
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.wlpl.com,https://admin.wlpl.com

# Rate Limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

See **[Developer Security Guidelines](docs/DEVELOPER_SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md)** for complete secure coding practices.

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Firebase configuration completed
- ✅ All main pages implemented
- ✅ **Google Gemini AI integration active** (migrated from OpenAI)
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ **Modern UX with toast notifications and confirmation modals**
- ✅ **Upload progress indicators**
- ✅ Rate limiting to stay within free API tiers
- ⚠️ Some code quality improvements needed (see code review findings)
- ⚠️ WebAuthn biometric auth needs device testing
- ⚠️ Health app integration needs platform-specific code

### Known Limitations
- Rate limited to 500 Gemini API requests per day (free tier)
- WebAuthn biometric auth requires HTTPS and compatible devices
- Health app integration (HealthKit/Google Fit) needs platform-specific native code
- Some TypeScript `any` types need proper interfaces

### Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Migrate from OpenAI to Google Gemini~~ (DONE)
2. ✅ ~~Add confirmation modals~~ (DONE)
3. ✅ ~~Add upload progress spinners~~ (DONE)
4. **Address critical security issues** (API endpoint authentication, CORS)
5. Test biometric authentication on physical devices
6. Implement image compression before upload
7. Deploy to production with environment variables

## 📝 Agent Team

This project was developed using a structured agent approach:

- **Frontend Agent**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Mobile UI
- **Backend Agent**: Firebase + API integration + WebAuthn
- **AI Agent**: OpenAI integration + meal analysis + recommendations
- **QA Agent**: Testing + accessibility + cross-browser compatibility

See `/agents/` directory for detailed specifications.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependencies failing to install**: Try clearing node_modules and package-lock.json
2. **Firebase connection issues**: Check .env.local configuration
3. **Camera not working**: Check browser permissions and HTTPS requirement
4. **TypeScript errors**: Ensure all types are properly imported

### Support
- Check agent documentation in `/agents/` for implementation details
- Review browser console for specific error messages
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
