## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project (configured)
- OpenAI API key (for meal analysis)

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   The `.env.local` file is already configured with your Firebase credentials. You need to add:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   USDA_API_KEY=your-usda-api-key
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Firebase configuration completed
- ✅ All main pages implemented
- ✅ AI meal analysis API ready
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ⚠️ Dependencies need installation
- ⚠️ Firebase Admin SDK needs testing
- ⚠️ OpenAI API integration needs real key

### Known Limitations
- Mock data used for AI analysis (needs OpenAI key)
- WebAuthn biometric auth needs device testing
- Firebase data operations not yet implemented
- Health app integration needs platform-specific code

### Next Steps
1. Install dependencies successfully
2. Add OpenAI API key for real meal analysis
3. Implement Firebase data operations
4. Test biometric authentication on devices
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Deploy to production

## 📝 Agent Team

This project was developed using a structured agent approach:

- **Frontend Agent**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Mobile UI
- **Backend Agent**: Firebase + API integration + WebAuthn
- **AI Agent**: OpenAI integration + meal analysis + recommendations
- **QA Agent**: Testing + accessibility + cross-browser compatibility

See `/agents/` directory for detailed specifications.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependencies failing to install**: Try clearing node_modules and package-lock.json
2. **Firebase connection issues**: Check .env.local configuration
3. **Camera not working**: Check browser permissions and HTTPS requirement
4. **TypeScript errors**: Ensure all types are properly imported

### Support
- Check agent documentation in `/agents/` for implementation details
- Review browser console for specific error messages
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
