## Workflow

### Working in a Worktree

```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd C:/Users/percy/wlpl/wlpl-native-wrapper

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add native wrapper"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/native-wrapper
```

### Creating a Pull Request

```bash
# From within the worktree
gh pr create --title "feat: Native wrapper integration" --body "Description"
```

### Switching Between Worktrees

```bash
# Simply navigate to different directories
cd C:/Users/percy/wlpl/weightlossprojectlab    # Main
cd C:/Users/percy/wlpl/wlpl-native-wrapper     # Feature work
```

### Syncing with Main

```bash
# From within a worktree
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Or rebase
git rebase origin/main
```

### Listing All Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
```

### Removing a Worktree (After Merged)

```bash
# From main repository
git worktree remove ../wlpl-native-wrapper

# Delete the branch
git branch -d feature/native-wrapper

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/native-wrapper
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Worktrees Updated
Regularly sync with main to avoid conflicts:
```bash
cd C:/Users/percy/wlpl/wlpl-native-wrapper
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

### 2. One Feature Per Worktree
Each worktree should focus on a single feature or improvement.

### 3. Regular Commits
Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.

### 4. Push Early and Often
Push your branch to remote regularly to enable collaboration and backups.

### 5. Clean Up After Merge
Remove worktrees and branches after PRs are merged.

### 6. Use Descriptive Branch Names
- `feature/` - New features
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Testing improvements
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `hotfix/` - Urgent bug fixes

## Development Priority

### Immediate (Start Now)
1. `feature/native-wrapper` - Critical for mobile health API access
2. `feature/social-expansion` - High user engagement impact
3. `feature/recipe-marketplace` - Key differentiator

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
4. `feature/premium-subscription` - Revenue generation
5. `test/e2e-suite` - Quality assurance
6. `perf/bundle-optimization` - User experience

### Medium-term (Future Sprints)
7. `refactor/react-19-features` - Technical debt
8. `docs/repository-cleanup` - Maintainability

## Troubleshooting

### Worktree Already Exists
```bash
# Remove and recreate
git worktree remove ../wlpl-native-wrapper
git worktree add ../wlpl-native-wrapper -b feature/native-wrapper
```

### Branch Already Exists
```bash
# Use existing branch
git worktree add ../wlpl-native-wrapper feature/native-wrapper

# Or delete and recreate
git branch -d feature/native-wrapper
git worktree add ../wlpl-native-wrapper -b feature/native-wrapper
```

### Can't Remove Worktree
```bash
# Force remove
git worktree remove --force ../wlpl-native-wrapper
```

## Git Configuration

All worktrees share the same git configuration from the main repository at:
- `C:/Users/percy/wlpl/weightlossprojectlab/.git/`

## Status Tracking

Track your progress across worktrees:

```bash
# Check status of all branches
git branch -a

# View recent commits across all branches
git log --all --oneline --graph -10
```

## VS Code Integration

Open multiple VS Code windows for parallel development:

```bash
code C:/Users/percy/wlpl/weightlossprojectlab
code C:/Users/percy/wlpl/wlpl-native-wrapper
code C:/Users/percy/wlpl/wlpl-social-expansion
```
