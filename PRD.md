### 8. Automatic Step Tracking

**User Story:** *As a user, I want my steps counted automatically in the background without manual entry.*

#### 8.1 Step Tracking Architecture
**Philosophy:** Manual step entry is impractical - users cannot accurately track steps throughout the day. Step tracking must be fully automatic using device motion sensors.

**Implementation:**
- **Global Context Provider:** `StepTrackingProvider` wraps entire app
- **Sensor Integration:** Uses device accelerometer/pedometer via `useStepCounter` hook
- **Background Tracking:** Counts steps continuously when enabled
- **Auto-Save Mechanisms:**
  - Saves to Firebase at midnight (checks every 60s)
  - Saves before page unload
  - User can manually save anytime

**Technical Flow:**
```
Device Motion Sensor
  ‚Üì
useStepCounter hook (sensor logic)
  ‚Üì
StepTrackingProvider (app-wide state)
  ‚Üì
useStepTracking() hook (components consume)
  ‚Üì
Firebase stepLogs collection (persistence)
```

#### 8.2 User Enabling/Disabling
**Locations:**
1. **Settings Page:** Toggle switch in "App Settings" section
2. **Log Steps Page:** Primary enable/disable button
3. **Dashboard:** Prompt card when disabled

**UX Features:**
- One-time enable: tracking runs continuously in background
- Clear visual feedback: pulsing green dot when active
- Live step count displayed on dashboard and log-steps page
- Preference saved to localStorage (future: Firebase user profile)

#### 8.3 Real-Time Activity Feed
**User Story:** *As a user, I want to check my step history like a social media feed to stay motivated.*

**Functionality:**
- **Recent Activity Section:** Shows last 7 days of step logs
- **Smart Date Formatting:** "Today", "Yesterday", "X days ago"
- **Goal Progress:** Color-coded percentage
  - Green: 100%+ (goal reached ‚úì)
  - Blue: 75-99% (close to goal)
  - Orange: Below 75%
- **Loading & Empty States:** Spinner while fetching, helpful prompts if no data
- **Real-Time Updates:** Fetches from Firebase `stepLogs` collection

**Engagement Strategy:**
Users frequently check the activity feed like social media/email to see progress accumulate throughout the day. This creates habit-forming engagement.

#### 8.4 Dashboard Integration
**Display:**
- **Activity Card:** Shows today's real-time step count
- **Live Indicator:** Pulsing green dot when tracking active
- **Progress Bar:** Visual representation of goal progress
- **Conditional CTA:**
  - If disabled: Blue prompt box with "Enable tracking ‚Üí"
  - If enabled: "View step details ‚Üí" link

**Design Decisions:**
- Removed "Log Steps" quick action button (redundant with Activity card)
- Removed duplicate links when tracking disabled
- Single source of truth for step tracking access

#### 8.5 Data Model
```typescript
interface StepLog {
  id: string
  userId: string
  steps: number
  date: string // YYYY-MM-DD format
  source: 'device' | 'sensor' | 'manual' | 'healthkit' | 'googlefit'
  loggedAt: Timestamp
  goal?: number
  notes?: string
}
```

**Firestore Location:**
```
users/{userId}/stepLogs/{stepLogId}
```

#### 8.6 Manual Entry Removed
**Decision:** Manual step entry completely removed from log-steps page.

**Rationale:**
- Impossible for users to accurately count steps throughout the day
- Manual entry would just be guesses/estimates
- Defeats the purpose of automatic tracking
- Creates confusion and bad data quality

**Result:** Log-steps page is 100% focused on automatic tracking with enable/disable controls.

### 9. Recipe Cooking Mode
