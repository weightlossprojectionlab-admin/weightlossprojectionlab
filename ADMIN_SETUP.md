## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
**Symptom:** Cannot access admin panel despite being super admin

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're logged in with correct email
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Log out and log back in
5. Check Firestore to confirm `role: 'admin'` exists

### API "Unauthorized" Error
**Symptom:** API calls fail with 401/403

**Solutions:**
1. Verify ID token is valid and not expired
2. Check Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
3. Confirm super admin email matches exactly
4. Check Firestore rules are deployed

### Role Not Updating
**Symptom:** Role change doesn't take effect

**Solutions:**
1. Log out and log back in
2. Check Firestore for role field
3. Verify role is one of: `admin`, `moderator`, `support`, or `null`
4. Check browser console for errors

## Best Practices

1. **Use Super Admin Sparingly:** Grant regular admin roles to team members instead of hardcoding more super admins

2. **Audit Regularly:** Review admin audit logs for suspicious activity

3. **Grant Minimum Permissions:** Use support/moderator roles when full admin isn't needed

4. **Document Actions:** Always provide notes when moderating content or resolving cases

5. **Test in Staging:** Test role changes in staging environment before production
